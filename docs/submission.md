# Submission Instructions

After you have added your Create Task info to the [Create Task Components][template] document:
1. Click on the Submit Assignment button.
1. Add a short note describing your status in the text box - for example, "Done," or "Unsure about abstractions," or "Very tired," orâ€¦ Since this is a shared Google Doc, I'm not sure if it would work to submit the document the way we usually do, the purpose of the comment in to provide a place to leave questions or feedback about the assignment as well as to trigger an event so that I will notice that you've done the assignment.
1. Click the Submit Assignment button.
