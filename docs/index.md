# Overview

<!-- img class="overview-image" src="" -->

Even though I can't give you direct feedback on your Create Task â€“ I can't tell you, for example, if your algorithms meet the AP's standards; what I can do is to give general feedback to the group. I could do a review of algorithms and the rubric lines that cover them.

Also you can talk to each other and review your work. For the Create Task you can also collaborate with another member of the class to develop the algorithms in your app.

So, I'd like you do add a summary of your Create Task project in a shared [Create Task Components][template] document. Then use that document to get ideas and find people to collaborate with and to provide feedback to each other.
