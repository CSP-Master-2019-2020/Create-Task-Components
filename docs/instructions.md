# Instructions

1. Make sure that you are signed in to your SKSD Google account.
1. Open the [Create Task Components][template] document and add your name in the **Name** column (do this even if you have not even started to think about the Create Task yet).
1. Go to [Create Task in App Lab][lesson]. Notice the Share button in the upper left hand corner of the App Lab window. Click on that button and copy the link. Paste that link into the **Link** column next to your name.
1. Then, as you make progress on your Create Task add information in the other columns: Description, Abstraction, Algorithms.

## Abstraction

Understanding abstraction is one of the more challenging concepts as you start your study of computer science (and since it can be a life long pursuit you are probably just starting). But the concept is actually one that you are very familiar with, we encounter it every day. One of the most common meanings of abstraction in computer science is ***hiding unnecessary detail*** – letting the user of the abstraction (you) get a job done without having to worry about the details that don't matter to the user of the abstraction. Some examples from everyday life:

* **Light switches** – a light switch hides the details of how you control power to a light and lets you focus on the task you actually care about: turning on or off a light.
* **Steering wheels in cars** – same idea, the steering wheel hides the details of how you control where the car is going and lets you focus on getting where you are going. You don't need to know how it works or anything other than the fact that you turn left to go left and right to go right.
* **Messaging apps** – again, you don't need to know how the app works, you can focus on communicating.

The "big deal" about abstraction in computer science and software development is that it ***reduces complexity*** and makes programs easier to develop and maintain. Going back to our everyday examples, a light switch also makes the work of designing a house easier. The designer just needs to indicate where they want the light switches to go and what the switches will control.

There are two big ways to "create" an abstraction (so far):

1. If you find yourself writing the same (or similar) code more than once, you can move this code into a function (or method, or procedure, or sub-routine – they all mean more or less the same thing). You can give the function a descriptive name – making your code easier to understand (less complex). This is an example of **procedural abstraction.**
1. If you find yourself creating similar "things," for example players in a game, you can create an array or a list to hold them. This makes you code more flexible, you don't need to know in advance how many of the things you will need. It also makes it _much_ easier to do common operations like manipulating each of the things (aka "iterating over an array or list"). This is an example of **data abstraction.**

If you'd like another take on abstraction, the College Board has produced two videos:

## Submitting

To submit the assignment, click on the **Submit Assignment** button and add a brief description of your status in the text box. Please submit the assignment this week, even if you are not able to fill in all of the columns yet. As you have more to add or if you improve your work you can resubmit the assignment.
